# MiniC Compiler

The **MiniC Compiler** is a project that involves developing a compiler for a subset of the C programming language, known as MiniC. This compiler will transform MiniC code into LLVM intermediate representation (IR), enabling the generation of executable binaries. The MiniC subset excludes certain language features, such as arrays, structs, pointers, and specific low-level operators.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of the project are to:

- Build a compiler for the MiniC language subset.
- Utilize C++ programming language for implementing the compiler.
- Incorporate the LLVM compiler framework for generating LLVM IR.
- Generate executable binaries from LLVM IR and evaluate them on an X86 target machine.

## Features

The MiniC Compiler will support the following language features:

- Basic data types: bool, int, and float.
- Variable and function declarations.
- Function parameters and return types.
- Expressions, encompassing arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations.
- Control flow constructs: if statements and while loops.
- Return statements.

## Part 2 - Types, Scope, and Code Generation

The second part of the project focuses on generating code using the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) created in Part 1. This part is more challenging as it involves careful handling of various aspects of compiler writing to produce working target code.

### Task 1 - LLVM IR Code Generation

Extend your parser to generate LLVM IR for the AST created after a successful parse. To achieve this, you can add a method called `codegen()` to each AST node class. This method should emit LLVM IR for the corresponding AST node and its children, recursively. Refer to the LLVM tutorial, specifically Chapters 3, 5, and 7, for guidance on generating IR for various language constructs.

Additionally, consider the following hints when generating LLVM IR:

- Utilize the `IRBuilder` class for generating code, including comparisons, loading, storing, and returning values.
- Use the `ConstantInt` and `ConstantFP` classes for representing boolean, integer, and floating-point constants.
- Implement semantic checks for type and scope of variables and functions. Output appropriate errors when these checks are violated.
- Adapt the LLVM functions for generating code for for loops to generate code for while loops as required for MiniC.

### Task 2 - Putting It All Together

This task involves using the generated LLVM IR to build a binary executable and test it on an X86 machine. Each example in the `tests/` directory includes a driver code `driver.cpp` that can be compiled along with the LLVM IR generated by your compiler to obtain an executable. The provided `tests.sh` script can be used to automate testing.

Here's how you can compile, build, and execute an example:

```bash
# Build compiler
make mccomp

# Compile MiniC code using your compiler
./mccomp example.c

# Compile driver code and LLVM IR to build an executable
clang++ driver.cpp output.ll -o example_executable

# Run the executable
./example_executable
```

All the IR code will be generated into a file called output.ll.

## Testing

Test the generated code on all the provided test cases using the `tests.sh` script.

## Usage

To compile MiniC code using the MiniC Compiler, execute the following command:

```bash
./minic_compiler input_file.c -o output_executable
```

Replace `input_file.mc` with your MiniC code file and `output_executable` with the desired name for the output executable.

## Limitations

The MiniC Compiler does not support certain language features, including arrays, structs, pointers, and specific low-level operators.
